# Learn-SQL-in-RStudio
This repository contains all project files that was used to create learning materials including blog posts to simplify the use-case of basic SQL queries in RStudio using R Markdown. In order to explore and learn basic SQL queries in Microsoft SQL Server, first you need to have a database. Data Simulation Research lab (DSRLab) developed their own datawarehouse using Microsoft SQL Server 2019 which is publicly open in a GitHub repository. I am going to use this sample database here to explore basic SQL queries. You can find the download link to the database from the GitHub repository at URL https://github.com/NikhilChandraSarkar/DSRLab-Data-Warehouse. On this page, you find the section for the DSRLab full database backups and the file called DSRLabDW_Full.bak. Letâ€™s go ahead and click on that link and download the file to your computer. Now you need to move the downloaded file into the Microsoft SQL Server backup folder on your computer and rename it as DSRLabDW. Then you can login to your Microsoft SQL Server using a Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio tool to restore the sample database on the server.
# Required Machine Learning Tools
I assume that you have installed following machine learning tools on your computer to reproduce this entire work.

1) Microsoft SQL Server 2015 or above,
2) Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio,
3) R and RStudio.
